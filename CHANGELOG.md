Please follow these instructions for updating Member Audit from 1.x. If you are already on 2.0.0 alpha you can ignore these special instructions.

1. Make sure you are on the latest stable version of Member Audit (1.15.2): `pip show aa-memberaudit`
1. Make sure your current AA installation has no error: `python manage.py check`
1. Shut down your AA instance completely: `sudo supervisorctl stop myauth:`
1. Optional: If you have any additional services that are connected with your AA instance (e.g. Discord bots) shut them down too.
1. Clear your cache: `sudo redis-cli flushall;`
1. Backup your AA database with your standard procedure (or use the example procedure shown below)
1. Install the update: `pip install aa-memberaudit==2.0.0`
1. Verify that the installation went through without any errors or warnings by checking the console output of the last command
1. Run migrate: `python manage.py migrate`
1. Verify that the migration went through without any errors or warnings by checking the console output of the last command

You can do a complete backup of your database by running the following commands:

### Added

- Characters and their (historical) data remain in the system, even after the related tokens have been revoked by the Character's owner.

This update has been successfully completed on different installations including in production. And just in case something goes wrong we are providing you with a restore procedure that allows you to fully restore your previous version and data.

Should you run into any issues and need help please give us a shout on the AA Discord (#community-packages).

Please kindly give us feedback about the result of your alpha test and what environment you used (e.g. Ubuntu 18.04 with Maria DB 10.5 and Alliance Auth 2.12.1), so we can determine when to release this version as stable.
