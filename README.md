# Member Audit

A *former* fork of https://gitlab.com/ErikKalkoken/aa-memberaudit modified for use by Gooseflock Featheration

This fork is retired and contains significant bugs that **WILL** result in an ESI ban. Do not use it.

## Changes

* Evemail viewer removed - good spies don't use evemails and bad spies can be caught without them. Also reading other people's DMs is creepy.
* Players can no longer view the Skill Sets page without view_skillset permission, sorry spies

## Bugfixes

* Doctrine report now shows all registered characters, including altcorps

## TODO:

* Fix tests
* Add killboard functionality
