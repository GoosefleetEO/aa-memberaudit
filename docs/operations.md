# Operations Manual

## Installation

### Step  0 - Check dependencies are installed

1. Member Audit is a plugin for Alliance Auth. If you don't have Alliance Auth running already, please install it first before proceeding. (see the official [AA installation guide](https://allianceauth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/auth/allianceauth/) for details)

2. Member Audit needs the app [django-eveuniverse](https://gitlab.com/ErikKalkoken/django-eveuniverse) to function. Please make sure it is installed, before before continuing.

### Step 1 - Install app

Make sure you are in the virtual environment (venv) of your Alliance Auth installation. Then install the newest release from PyPI:

```bash
pip install aa-memberaudit
```

### Step 2 - Configure Auth settings

Configure your Auth settings (`local.py`) as follows:

- Add `'memberaudit'` to `INSTALLED_APPS`
- Add below lines to your settings file:

```python
CELERYBEAT_SCHEDULE['memberaudit_run_regular_updates'] = {
    'task': 'memberaudit.tasks.run_regular_updates',
    'schedule': crontab(minute=0, hour='*/1'),
}
```

- Optional: Add additional settings if you want to change any defaults. See [Settings](#settings) for the full list.

### Step 3 - Finalize App installation

Run migrations & copy static files

```bash
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py collectstatic
```

Restart your supervisor services for Auth

### Step 4 - Update EVE Online API Application

Update the Eve Online API app used for authentication in your AA installation to include the following scopes:

- `esi-assets.read_assets.v1`
- `esi-bookmarks.read_character_bookmarks.v1`
- `esi-calendar.read_calendar_events.v1`
- `esi-characters.read_agents_research.v1`
- `esi-characters.read_blueprints.v1`
- `esi-characters.read_contacts.v1`
- `esi-characters.read_fatigue.v1`
- `esi-characters.read_fw_stats.v1`
- `esi-characters.read_loyalty.v1`
- `esi-characters.read_medals.v1`
- `esi-characters.read_notifications.v1`
- `esi-characters.read_opportunities.v1`
- `esi-characters.read_standings.v1`
- `esi-characters.read_titles.v1`
- `esi-clones.read_clones.v1`
- `esi-clones.read_implants.v1`
- `esi-contracts.read_character_contracts.v1`
- `esi-corporations.read_corporation_membership.v1`
- `esi-industry.read_character_jobs.v1`
- `esi-industry.read_character_mining.v1`
- `esi-killmails.read_killmails.v1`
- `esi-location.read_location.v1`
- `esi-location.read_online.v1`
- `esi-location.read_ship_type.v1`
- `esi-mail.organize_mail.v1`
- `esi-mail.read_mail.v1`
- `esi-markets.read_character_orders.v1`
- `esi-markets.structure_markets.v1`
- `esi-planets.manage_planets.v1`
- `esi-planets.read_customs_offices.v1`
- `esi-search.search_structures.v1`
- `esi-skills.read_skillqueue.v1`
- `esi-skills.read_skills.v1`
- `esi-universe.read_structures.v1`
- `esi-wallet.read_character_wallet.v1`

### Step 5 - Verify Celery configuration

Member Audit makes very heavy use of Celery and will run many thousand tasks every hour.

The minimum configuration for an average installation (approx. 500 characters) is the following:

- 10 thread based workers
- All workers can run continuously without degrading overall server performance

Please see the section [Celery Configuration](#celery-configuration) on how to configure celery to run more efficiently.

```{important}
This app will not work with the default setup for celery from the official AA installation guide. The default configuration is inefficient and not able to handle the task load from Member Audit. If you task queue is ever increasing this might be the reason.
```

### Step 6 - Load Eve Universe map data

In order to be able to select solar systems and ships types for trackers you need to load that data from ESI once. If you already have run those commands previously you can skip this step.

Load Eve Online map:

```bash
python manage.py eveuniverse_load_data map
```

```bash
python manage.py memberaudit_load_eve
```

You may want to wait until the loading is complete before continuing.

```{hint}
These command will spawn a thousands of tasks. One easy way to monitor the progress is to watch the number of tasks shown on the Dashboard.
```

### Step 7 - Setup permissions

Finally you want to setup permission to define which users / groups will have access to which parts of the app. Check out [permissions](#permissions) for details.

Congratulations you are now ready to use Member Audit!

## Updating

To update your existing installation of Member Audit first enable your virtual environment.

Then run the following commands from your AA project directory (the one that contains `manage.py`).

```bash
pip install -U aa-memberaudit
```

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

```bash
python manage.py collectstatic
```

Finally restart your AA supervisor services.

## Permissions

For this app there are two types of permissions:

- Feature permissions give access to a feature
- Scope permissions give access to scope

To define a role you will mostly need at least one permission from each type. For example for the recruiter role you will want `finder_access`, that gives access to the character finder tool, and `view_shared_characters`, so that the recruiter can see all shared characters.

The exception is the basic role, `basic_access`, that every user needs just to access the app. It does not require any additional scope roles, so a normal user just needs that role to be able to register his characters.

### Permission list

Name | Description | Type
-- | -- | --
`basic_access`| Can access this app and register and view own characters | Feature
`share_characters`| Can share his characters. Note that others need the <br>`view_shared_characters` permission to see them.  | Feature
`finder_access`| Can access character finder features for accessing characters<br>from others | Feature
`reports_access`| Can access reports features for seeing reports and analytics. | Feature
`characters_access`| Can access characters owned by others. | Feature
`exports_access`| Can access data exports.<br>Warning: This permission gives access to all data from all<br>characters and does not require any additional scope permissions. | Feature
`view_shared_characters`| All characters, which have been marked as shared &<br>can access these characters | Feature & Scope
`view_same_corporation`| All mains - incl. their alts -  of the same corporations<br>the user's main belongs to | Scope
`view_same_alliance`| All mains - incl. their alts -  of the same alliances<br>the user's main belongs to | Scope
`view_everything`| All characters registered with Member Audit | Scope
`notified_on_character_removal` | Get a notification when someone drops a character. | Feature

```{hint}
All permissions can be found under the category "memberaudit | general".
```

### Example Roles

To further illustrate how the permission system works, see the following list showing which permissions are needed to define common roles:

Role | Description | Permissions
-- | -- | --
Normal user | Can use this app and register and access own characters | `basic_access`
Recruiter | Can access shared characters | `basic_access`<br>`finder_access`<br>`view_shared_characters`
Corporation Leadership | Can access reports for his corporation members<br>(but can not access the characters) | `basic_access`<br>`reports_access`<br>`view_same_corporation`
Corp Leadership & Recruiter | Can access shared characters | `basic_access`<br>`finder_access`<br>`view_shared_characters`<br>`reports_access`<br>`view_same_corporation`
Alliance Auditor | Can search for and access all characters of his alliance  | `basic_access`<br>`finder_access`<br>`characters_access`<br>`view_same_alliance`<br>`notified_on_character_removal`

> **Note**<br>Naturally, superusers will have access to everything, without requiring permissions to be assigned.

## Celery configuration

### Task throughput

This app makes heavy use of Celery and will often run thousands of tasks per hour. AA's default Celery setup is not well suited for handling high task volumes though (e.g. it will only spawn one worker per core, which scale badly due to high CPU usage). We strongly recommend to switch to a thread based setup (e.g. gevent), which has been proven to be significantly more efficient for running AA.

For details on how to configure celery workers with threads please see [this section](https://allianceauth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/maintenance/tuning/celery.html#increasing-task-throughput) in the AA's documentation.

When switching to thread based workers please also make sure to setup measure to protect against memory leak. The default celery options will not work for threads. See [this section](https://allianceauth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/maintenance/tuning/celery.html#supervisor) for details.

### ESI connection pool

If you have more than 10 workers you also need to increase the connection pool for django-esi accordingly. You can do this by adding the following line to your local settings (e.g. for 20 workers):

```python
ESI_CONNECTION_POOL_MAXSIZE = 20
```

See [here](https://gitlab.com/allianceauth/django-esi/-/blob/master/esi/app_settings.py#L36) for the corresponding setting in django-esi.

### Celery priorities

Last, but not least, please make sure your Celery is configured to run with priorities. This should be the default for all current Auth installation, but if you have an older installation you may have missed this change. Please see [these release notes](https://gitlab.com/allianceauth/allianceauth/-/releases/v2.6.3) for details.

### Member Audit configuration

The goal of an optimal configuration for Member Audit is that your system can complete all update tasks for your character within the respective update cycle.

For this you need to consider the following three factors:

- Number of characters to update
- Task throughput
- Update frequency

The number of characters depend on your organization. You an usually not influence this factor much and want to make sure that your system has sufficient room for that growth.

Your task throughout is defined by the number of celery workers. The more workers you have, the higher your potential throughput, so you may want to maximize that number for your system.

You can adjust the update frequency to meet your needs. For example if you have a lot of characters and your update tasks can not (or only barely) complete within the update cycle, then you can lengthen your update cycles to compensate. There are 3 update cycles called rings, which can be configured individually. See `MEMBERAUDIT_UPDATE_STALE_RING_x` in [settings](#settings) for details.

```{hint}
You can use the management command **memberaudit_stats** to get current data about the last update runs, which can be very helpful to find the optimal configuration. See [memberaudit_stats](#memberaudit_stats) for details.
```

## Settings

Name | Description | Default
-- | -- | --
`APP_UTILS_NOTIFY_THROTTLED_TIMEOUT`| Timeout for throttled notifications in seconds. This defines how often throttled user notifications are send. | (see [Settings](https://allianceauth-app-utils.readthedocs.io/en/latest/settings.html) for App Utils})
`MEMBERAUDIT_APP_NAME`| Name of this app as shown in the Auth sidebar. | `'Member Audit'`
`MEMBERAUDIT_DATA_RETENTION_LIMIT`| Maximum number of days to keep historical data for mails, contracts and wallets. Minimum is 7 day. `None` will turn it off. | `360`
`MEMBERAUDIT_ESI_ERROR_LIMIT_THRESHOLD`| ESI error limit remain threshold. The number of remaining errors is counted down from 100 as errors occur. Because multiple tasks may request the value simultaneously and get the same response, the threshold must be above 0 to prevent the API from shutting down with a 420 error | `25`
`MEMBERAUDIT_BULK_METHODS_BATCH_SIZE`| Technical parameter defining the maximum number of objects processed per run of Django batch methods, e.g. bulk_create and bulk_update | `500`
`MEMBERAUDIT_LOCATION_STALE_HOURS`| Hours after a existing location (e.g. structure) becomes stale and gets updated. e.g. for name changes of structures | `24`
`MEMBERAUDIT_LOG_UPDATE_STATS`| When set True will log the statistics of the latests uns at the start of every new run. The stats show the max, avg, min durations from the last run for each round and each section in seconds. Note that the durations are not 100% exact, because some updates happen in parallel the the main process and may take longer to complete (e.g. loading mail bodies, contract items) | `24`
`MEMBERAUDIT_MAX_MAILS`| Maximum amount of mails fetched from ESI for each character | `250`
`MEMBERAUDIT_TASKS_MAX_ASSETS_PER_PASS`| Technical parameter defining the maximum number of asset items processed in each pass when updating character assets. A higher value reduces overall duration, but also increases task queue congestion. | `2500`
`MEMBERAUDIT_TASKS_TIME_LIMIT`| Global timeout for tasks in seconds to reduce task accumulation during outages | `7200`
`MEMBERAUDIT_UPDATE_STALE_RING_1`| Minutes after which sections belonging to ring 1 are considered stale: location, online status | `55`
`MEMBERAUDIT_UPDATE_STALE_RING_2`| Minutes after which sections belonging to ring 2 are considered stale: all except those in ring 1 & 3 | `235`
`MEMBERAUDIT_UPDATE_STALE_RING_3`| Minutes after which sections belonging to ring 3 are considered stale: assets | `475`

## Management Commands

The following management commands are available to perform administrative tasks:

```{hint}
Run any command with `--help` to see all options
```

### memberaudit_data_export

Export data into a CSV file for use with external applications. Will include data from all characters in the database.

Currently supports the wallet journal only.

### memberaudit_load_eve

Pre-loads data required for this app from ESI to improve app performance.

### memberaudit_reset_characters

Make sure to stop all supervisors before using this command.
```

### memberaudit_stats

This command returns current statistics as JSON, i.e. current update statistics and app totals. This includes:

- App totals with number of active users and characters
- List of periodic celery tasks
- Statistics about last update per ring, including:
  - total duration
  - est. throughput in characters per hour
  - indicator if update was completed within time boundaries
